# CS-Notes

Notes for Class 9th, 10th ICSE, and 11th ISC (An Indian Education Board) made by me for my prep. Sharing them for the benefit of future generations.

## How to Study
You will receive many books and materials throughout your 4 years of CS preparation in high school and so you might ask, "How to approach studying CS?" **As a simple rule of thumb, know every single line of these notes on your fingertips.** The books are for understanding and practise.

To best understand Java, do the following:
* Attend lectures. Ask many questions.
* Read the book. Practise the questions.
* Memorise the notes for exams.
* Play around in your IDE. Try a bunch of stuff. Identify real life problems which you can solve using code, and try to make code solutions to those problems. Think and research how you can make your solution better. Explore the capabilities of the language (what functions and structures it offers) in documentation. Break your presuppositions and test your understanding. Fail... and emerge. Godspeed.
