Open source notes for ICSE class 10 students appearing for board exams in 2021. Detailed theory notes with contribution from industry leading students adding their knowledge to the ultimate notes repository to study from. Enjoy.

For editors:
Briefly write here what you changed.
Also make your own branches, dont work on the main document. We will add stuff we all agree on from your individual branches to the main file.
Good luck.

Krishak you pls do the first chapter.
Riti you can do the array chapter.
Divit you can do strings and maybe the theory questions you wanted to add.
Udaj pls do the second chapter.

Once these chapters are done, we will combine all of them and the second version of the notes will be uploaded in the main branch. Then we can all focus on that file and make changes.
