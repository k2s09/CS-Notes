# Comp-notes-2020-21
Open source notes for ICSE class 10 students appearing for board exams in 2021. Detailed theory notes with contribution from industry leading students adding their knowledge to the ultimate notes repository to study from. Enjoy.

Krishak you pls do the first chapter.

How to do:
1) Go in your branch (I have already created it). Don't make changes in main or in other's branches.
2) The same files in main will be there
3) You can download them, edit it, add your notes. Don't worry, the changes will not be reflected in main.
4) Then upload the edited file in your branch with a different name like file 2.0
5) Don't delete the ones already there as they can serve as checkpoints if you ever want to go back to it
6) When you are completely done with all of your notes, do a pull request, asking to merge your branch with main.
7) Don't call for pull requests when you're halfway done
8) When everyone is done with their notes and they do pull request, I will merge them all to form the second edition of the main file
9) Then you all can download the second edition of the main file and make changes if you see fit from any chapter.
10) This way all the notes will be edited and double checked by us.
11) Make sure to have notifications on
12) Make sure to document what all changes you are making in the changes file.
