# CS-Notes

Notes for Class 9th, 10th ICSE, and 11th ISC (An Indian Education Board) made by me for my prep. Sharing them for the benefit of future generations.

## How to Study
Young padawan, you will receive many books and material throughout your 4 years of CS preparation in high school and so you might ask, "how to approach studying CS?" 

**As a simple rule of thumb, you should know every single line of these notes on your fingertips.** The books are for understanding and practise. To best understand Java, read on the notes, go through the book and just play around in your IDE, try a bunch of stuff. Try to make code solutions to real life problems and explore the capabilities of the language. Break your presuppositions and test your understanding. Fail... and emerge. Godspeed.
